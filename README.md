# My Portfolio Site built with Vue, TypeScript and Vite

## My Goals

- [ ] Build a simple portfolio site for my projects using Vue and Vite
- [ ] Build and use a simple CI pipeline (e.g. GitHub actions, linting and formatting)
- [ ] Incorporate TypeScript where I can
- [ ] Introduce front end testing (e.g. Cypress)
- [ ] Use some fun styling
- [ ] Introduce some API interaction (e.g. GitHub?)
- [ ] Use branching and PRs

## Ideas for Later
