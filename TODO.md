##Â Next Steps

- [ ] Add theme switch toggle
- [ ] Merge current branch into main!

## Ideas for Later

- [ ] Add to docs about things you've used (prettier, eslint setup, ci, husky, lint-staged, commitlint, pinia)
- [ ] Do cypress component/e2e testing (since it's new avoid tdd for now)
- [ ] Add form at bottom of scroll?
- [ ] Routing
- [ ] Make fun themes instead of just dark vs light (but that still correspond to dark/light). Possibly that relate to my interests?
- [ ] Custom scrollbar?
- [ ] More animations?
- [ ] Test on different browsers
- [ ] Have projects overview page too where you can click to jump to specific project
- [ ] If site is fully scrollable, still have buttons at top (e.g. for form) that allow you jump to right page easily
- [ ] Keep using semantic tags
- [ ] Look into accessibility and use checks
- [ ] Theme ideas: sun blue vs night starts, beach, hearts
- [ ] Try parallax background
